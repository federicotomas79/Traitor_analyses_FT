# Traitor_analyses
 
Analyses done with Traitor's measurements (https://github.com/TankredO/traitor).

### 3.1_validation.R
 
We used Traitor to extract seed traits of 1,230 taxa from the DiasMorph image dataset. We compared the length and width values extracted by Traitor with manual measurements (manual_measurements.csv in data folder).


### 3.2a_colours_humans_Rosaceae.R

Examples of on how colour values per seed can be used to obtain representative colours of taxa in the Rosaceae family within the DiasMorph dataset.


### 3.2b_dominant_colours_Fragaria_vesca.R

Visualise colour variation within and among seeds of Fragaria vesca.


### 3.3_colours_phylogeny_Asteraceae.R

Assess phylogenetic signal of seed colour in the Asteraceae family within the DiasMorph dataset.


### 3.4_shape.R

Construction of objective and interpretable category systems using the shape outline standardised for size invariance of Carex species within the DiasMorph dataset.
